# 🍽️ Online Food Ordering System

A web-based food ordering platform developed using **ASP.NET Web Forms** and **SQL Server** as part of my M.Sc. (Computer Science) academic project.

This system allows users to browse food items, add them to cart, and place orders. Admin users can manage food items, handle orders, and approve or reject bookings via a dashboard.
